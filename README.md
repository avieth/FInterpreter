FInterpreter
============

The definitions in this module facilitate the interpretation of free monads
over functor sums using interpreters for free monads over each of the summands.
Follow the [demonstration](Demonstration.lhs) for an exaplanation and
motivating example (also available as a
[gist](https://gist.github.com/avieth/334201aa341d9a00c7fc) which respects
the markdown).
